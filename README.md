# Human-Face-Generator-DCGAN

## Data
CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)
Created by: Multimedia Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong
http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

## Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Neural Network (DCGAN)

Build DCGAN to generate celeb images
The model has 2 parts:
1. Generator
2. Discriminator

### Discriminator
- A Convolution Network to identify between the true images and fake images
- We trained the Discriminator by the true images - data, and fake images - images generated by Generator

### Generator
- The Generator will generate images from a random vector with dimension 100.


## Summary
- The Discriminator try to identify between real images and fake iamges generated by the Generator
- The Generator try to create fake images that could trick the Discriminator to believe those are real images
- By training 2 models follow time, our Generator will get better and better in generating images which could looks exactly like real human.
